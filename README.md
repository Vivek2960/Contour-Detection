# Contour-Detection
Detecting the edges of the contour using computer vision techniques

**Introduction**
In modern computer vision and image processing, detecting and analyzing objects within images is a crucial task with diverse applications ranging from industrial automation to medical imaging. This project focuses on using Python libraries to process an image, detect objects, and visualize them by drawing bounding rectangles around them. The approach involves converting the image to grayscale, applying thresholding to segment objects from the background, finding contours, and drawing bounding boxes based on contour characteristics and their spatial relationships.

**Abstract**
This project demonstrates an image processing pipeline using Python's OpenCV and NumPy libraries. The pipeline includes converting an image to grayscale, applying binary thresholding to segment objects, detecting contours, filtering these contours based on area, and combining nearby contours to create unified bounding boxes. The final result is visualized using Matplotlib, showcasing both individual and combined bounding rectangles on the original image. The project provides a foundational understanding of basic image processing techniques and their practical application in object detection and visualization.

**Summary**
The project provides a practical example of image processing techniques using Python. By converting an image to grayscale, applying thresholding, detecting contours, and drawing bounding rectangles, it illustrates fundamental concepts in object detection. The project uses OpenCV for image manipulation, NumPy for numerical calculations, and Matplotlib for visualization. The approach filters contours based on their area and combines nearby contours to create a unified representation of objects within an image. This pipeline is essential for applications requiring object detection and spatial analysis.
